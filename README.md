While I try to learn rust I'm rebuilding everything I built using C when I was first learning C in high-school and later in college

## What I already did

1. Palindrome (did this with vectors, vectors are not found in c so boy did I have fun with it)
1. Fibonacci  (also with vectors)

## WIP 

1. Binary Search
2. Sort (Bubble, Insertion, etc)

## Something basic I can try my hands on?

PS. If you email me after I archive this repo I might still try it out.
